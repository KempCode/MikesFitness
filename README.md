## Features

- Track weekly increases in weightlifting programs.
- Enter workout data, such as repetitions and weights lifted, for each exercise.
- Save workout data using SharedPreferences.
- Simple and intuitive interface.
- Works best on real devices, running smoothly on devices like the Oppo Phone.

## Why This App?

This app was born out of the need to track progress in weightlifting programs efficiently. By providing a straightforward interface to enter workout data and saving it for future reference, it helps users stay organized and motivated in their fitness journey.

## Usage

1. Open the app to view each day of the week.
2. Click on a specific day to view the exercises for that day's workout.
3. Enter workout data, such as the weight lifted and repetitions, into the corresponding EditText fields.
4. Press the "Save Workout" button to store the entered information.

Please note that the app works best when running on a real device rather than being plugged into Android Studio. Additionally, static XML layouts were chosen over using adapters with RecyclerView or GridView due to time constraints. Despite this, efforts were made to optimize the XML layouts to improve performance.
